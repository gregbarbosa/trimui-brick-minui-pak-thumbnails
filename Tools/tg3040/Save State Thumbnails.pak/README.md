### v1 Roadmap

- [x] Save state images: move original images to `/boxart`
- [ ] Box art images: remove save state thumbnails and move images back from `/boxart`
- [x] Iterate through all ROM folder saves state images
- [ ] Timestamping to only update _new_ images

### v2 Roadmap

- [ ] Use symlinks instead of copying assets. I'd lose the bordered thumbnails, but it would be easier to manage.
